# 3D-AFM-codes
This is a workflow to construct process the 3D-AFM raw data, do 3D-AFM averaging and plot the figures. The codes are developed in BIO-AFM-LAB at Weill Cornell Medicine under the supervision of Professor Simon Scheuring.

Developer: Runze Ma, Yining Jiang

Publication: XXX.

User should email to the corresponding author of the paper for details about this work: Professor Simon Scheuring (sis2019@med.cornell.edu)

NOTE: Any usage of the codes should cite the publication mentioned above.

## System requirements:
1. Operating system for code development : Windows 10
2. Software for code development: MATLAB (MathWorks) 2024b.
3. Additional add-ons: MIJI
4. Non-standard hardware: N/A

## Installation instructions: 
1. The codes require installation of MATLAB (MathWorks) 2024b. An installation guide can be found at: https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/.
2. MIJI is recommanded (not required) for visualizing data. An installation guide can be found at: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47545-mij-running-imagej-and-fiji-within-matlab. If MIJI is not installed, user should comment out any code that uses MIJI for visualization (lines starting sith "MIJ.xxx").
3. The installation should take less than one hour on a "normal" desktop computer.
